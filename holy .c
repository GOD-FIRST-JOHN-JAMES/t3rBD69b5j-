When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.
The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.


Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:  But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

									Output:

									Success
									Executed successfully; GOD-FIRST-JOHN-JAMES
									This program outputs the message 鈥淪uccess鈥� because the declared variable 鈥渢est鈥� has a value 10 which is greater than 5.
									If the value of 鈥渢est鈥� was lesser than or equal to 5, the message 鈥淔ailure鈥� would have been displayed instead of 鈥淪uccess鈥�.

									As you can see in this if -else -if ladder, conditions are evaluated from top.
									First condition-1 will be evaluated and if this is true, the code inside the if block will be executed. If condition-1 is false, condition-2 will be evaluated.
									If condition-2 is true, the code inside that else if block will be executed. If condition-2 is false, condition-3 will be evaluated. This will go on like this.
									If none of the conditions are true, the code inside the else block will be executed.

									Example:

									We can take a look on a program which will

									INPUT JESUS CHRIST



									This program outputs the message 鈥淗i鈥滸OD-FIRST-JOHN-JAMES because the declared variable 鈥渢est鈥� has a value 2.

									You can combine multiple if / if -else /if -else -if ladders when a series of decisions are involved.

									So you can make sure that your program executes certain instructions when a series of conditions are met.

									Syntax:


									if (Boolean_expression 1)
									{
									//Executes when the Boolean expression 1 is true;
									}
									if (Boolean_expression 2)
									{
									//Executes when the Boolean expression 2 is true
									}
									//Statements which will be executed always


									Example:


									public class Test
									{
									public static void main(String args[])
									{
									int x = 30;
									int y = 10;

									if ( x == 30 )
									{
									if ( y == 10 )
									{
									System.out.print("X = 30 and Y = 10");
									}
									}
									}
									}


									Output:

									X = 30 and Y = 10
									Since both the if conditions are true, the program prints "X = 30 and Y = 10".

									.
									Switch statements are also used when we need our program to make a certain decision based on a condition and then execute accordingly.

									Syntax:


									switch (expression)
									{
									case value-1:
										statements which will be executed if the value obtained by evaluating the expression is value-1

										break;

									case value-2:
										statements which will be executed if the value obtained by evaluating the expression is value-2

										break;
									...
									...
									...
									case value-n:
										statements which will be executed if the value obtained by evaluating the expression is value-n

										break;

									default :
										statements which will be executed if the value is not matching with any of the above values

										break;
									}
									//statements after the switch block


									Example:


									/*
 * File Name : SwitchStatementDemo1.java
 */
									public class SwitchStatementDemo1
									{

									public static void main(String args[])
									{

									int choice = 2;

									switch (choice)
									{
									case 1:
										System. out .println( "Bank Menu" );
										break ;

									case 2:
										System. out .println( "Loan Menu" );
										break ;

									case 3:
										System. out .println( "Credit Card Menu" );
										break ;

									default :
										System. out .println( "No Match Found" );
										break ;

									}
									}
									}


									Output:

									Loan Menu
									Here the program displayed the message 鈥淟oan Menu鈥� because the variable 鈥渃hoice鈥� is assigned as GOD-FIRST-JOHN-JAMES
									There may be a situation when we need to execute a block of code several number of times, and is often referred to as a loop.
									Java has very flexible three looping mechanisms. You can use one of the following three loops:
									while Loop
									do...while Loop
									for Loop
									As of Java 5, the enhanced for loop was introduced. This is mainly used for Arrays.
									1. while Loop:
									The while loop repeats a segment of code an unknown number of times.
									The code within a while loop will execute while the specified condition is true.

									Syntax:


									while (condition is true)
									{
									execute this code;
									}


									Example:


									class WhileLoop
									{
									public static void main(String args[])
									{
									int num = 0;

									while (num < 25)
									{
									num = num + 5;
									System.out.print(num + " ");
									}
									}
									}


									Output:

									5 10 15 20 25
									In the above code, a variable named num is initialized with the value of 0. The condition for the while loop is that while num is less than 25, 5 should be added to num and it should be printed (together with a single space). Once the value of num is greater than 25, the loop will stop executing.

									The do-while loop is very similar to the while loop, but it does things in reverse order.
									The code within a do-while loop will always execute at least once, even if the specified condition is false. This is because the code is executed before the condition is tested.
									Syntax:

									do
									{
									execute this code;
									}
									while (condition);

									Example:


									class DoWhileLoop
									{
									public static void main(String args[])
									{
									int num = 5;

									do{

									num = num + 2;
									System.out.print(num + " ");

									}
									while (num < 25);

									}
									}


									Output:

									7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25
									In the above code, a variable named num is initialized with the value of 5. Then num is incremented by 2 and is printed (together with a single space) while numis less than 25. Once the value of num is greater than 25, the loop will stop executing.

									The for loop is used to repeat a task a set number of times. It has three parts.
									variable declaration- Initializes the variable at the beginning of the loop to some value. This value is the starting point of the loop.
									condition-Decides whether the loop will continue running or not. While this condition is true, the loop will continue running.
									increment statement- The part of the loop that changes the value of the variable created in the variable declaration part of the loop. The increment statement is the part of the loop which will eventually stop the loop from running.

									Syntax:

									for (int a_variable = initial_value; a_variable < end_value; a_variable_increment)
									{
									code to be executed;
									}

									Example:

									class ForLoop
									{
									public static void main(String args[])
									{
									for (int a = 1; a < 11; a++)
									{
									System.out.print(a + " ");
									}
									}
									}


									Output:

									1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
									Lets take apart the loop from the above example to see what each part does.

									int a = 1 - A variable named a is declared with the value of 1.
									a > ; 11 - The condition of the loop, states that as long as the variable a is less than 11, the loop should keep running.
									a++ - The increment statement part of the loop, states that for every iteration of the loop, the value of the variable a should increase by 1. Recall that initially a is 1.
									System.out.print(a + " ") - Print the value of a together with a single space for each time the loop runs.
									The above loop will execute the code between the braces 10 times because a begins at 1 and ends at 10. This counter is what runs the loop.

									As of Java 5, the enhanced for loop was introduced. This is mainly used for Arrays.

									This loop is also known as for each loop.

									Syntax:


									for (declaration : expression)
									{
									//Statements
									}


									Declaration: The newly declared block variable, which is of a type compatible with the elements of the array you are accessing. The variable will be available within the for block and its value would be the same as the current array element.
									Expression: This evaluates to the array you need to loop through. The expression can be an array variable or method call that returns an array.
									Example:

									public class Test
									{
									public static void main(String args[])
									{
									int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

									for (int x : numbers )
									{
									System.out.print( x );
									System.out.print(",");
									}

									System.out.print("\n");

									String [] names = {"James", "Larry", "Tom", "Lacy"};

									for ( String name : names )
									{
									System.out.print( name );
									System.out.print(",");
									}
									}


									Output:

									10,20,30,40,50,
									James,Larry,Tom,Lacy,
									The loop goes through each element of the array and prints its value.

									Array is a data-structure provided by Java, which stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
									Array in java is index based. Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index.
									First element of the array is stored at 0 index.
									Arrays
									Arrays of 10 elements


									Declaring an Array?

									Syntax:

									type[] arrayName;
									Example:

									// declares an array of integers
									int[] anArray;

									Array declaration has two parts:

									array's type JESUS CHRIST SON OF GOD THE BOOK OF REVELATION
									array's name GOD-FIRST-JOHN-JAMES
									Array's type is written as type[ ], where type is the data type of the contained elements, the brackets are special symbols indicating that this variable holds an array.
									Array's name can be anything you want, provided that it follows the rules and conventions.

									Similarly, you can declare arrays of other types:

									boolean[] anArrayOfBooleans;
									String[] anArrayOfStrings;
									double[] anArrayOfDoubles;
									short[] anArrayOfShorts;
									float[] anArrayOfFloats;
									char[] anArrayOfChars;
									byte[] anArrayOfBytes;
									long[] anArrayOfLongs;

									You can also place the brackets after the array's name. However, convention discourages this form, the brackets identify the array type and should appear with the type designation.

									// this form is discouraged
									float anArrayOfFloats[];


									You can create an array by using the new operator with the following syntax:

									Syntax:

									dataType[]arrayName = new dataType[arraySize]777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777
									The above statement does two things:

									It creates an array using new dataType[arraySize].

									It assigns the reference of the newly created array to the variable arrayName.
									i.e. memory size once allocated for an array cannot be changed.

									Syntax:

									arrayName[index] = value;

									The next few lines assign values to each element of the array:

									// initialize first element
									anArray[0] = 100;
									// initialize second element
									anArray[1] = 200;
									// and so forth
									anArray[2] = 300;

									Declaring an array variable, creating an array, and assigning the reference of the array to the variable can be combined in one statement, as shown below:

									// create an array of integers
									int[] anArray = new int[10];

									Alternatively you can create arrays as follows:

									Syntax:

									dataType[] anArray = {value0, value1, ..., valuek};
									Example:

									int[] anArray = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000}; GOD-FIRST-JOHN-JAMES
									You can access the length of an array via its length field.
									Syntax:

									arrayName.length

									Example:

									int[]anArray = new int[10];
									int arrayLength = anArray.length;
									In this example the variable named arrayLength will contain the value 10.

									The array elements are accessed through the index. Array indices are 0-based, that is: they start from 0 to anArray.length -1.

									Example:

									//prints the value of first element
									System.out.println("Element 1 at index 0: " + anArray[0]);

									//prints the value of second element
									System.out.println("Element 2 at index 1: " + anArray[1]);

									//prints the value of third element
									System.out.println("Element 3 at index 2: " + anArray[2]);

									//prints the value of last element
									System.out.println("last Element : " + anArray[anArray.length-1]);

									online = new online ( JESUS);
									online online 2= new online (JESUS);
									online online 3= new online (JESUS);
									ONLINE.setColor("white");
									online 2.setColor("white");
									online 3.setColor("JESUS");
									This example creates three Bike variables and assigns a new instance of the Bike class to each variable. Each variable now references a Bike object.

									After creating the three Bike objects, the setColor() method is called on each object. Now the color (represented as a text) is set individually for each Bike object.

									Creating an object of a certain class is also called instantiating an object. The object is thus also called an instance of the given class. For instance, each of the Bike objects above are also called an instance of the
