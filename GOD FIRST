About issues
Custom media types
These are the supported media types for this set of endpoints:

application/vnd.github.raw+json
application/vnd.github.text+json
application/vnd.github.html+json
application/vnd.github.full+json
For more information about media types, see "Media types."

List issues assigned to the authenticated user
List issues assigned to the authenticated user across all visible repositories including owned repositories, member repositories, and organization repositories. You can use the filter query parameter to fetch issues that are not necessarily assigned to you.

Note: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.
