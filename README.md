Relevant information about the education section
The education section of the GLD harmonized dataset provides information to the user on the educational level of the individuals interviewed in the HLFS. Usually this section will resemble fully the documentation from the raw dataset, yet, in this case the user will find useful additional information to understand the decisions made on the harmonized files.

The education section in the harmonized file
The education section contains variables that explain the concepts of literacy, education achieved and length of stay in formal education. To construct these variables, the harmonization team used the variable age from the dataset and research papers with information about the education system changes in TÃ¼rkiye, the main external document used can be found here.

Changes in the Turksish education system
The formal education system in TÃ¼rkiye is divided into primary education, lower secondary education, upper secondary education and vocational training, and higher education. Figure 1. shows the formal education system and the total years needed for completing each level.

The structure above changed in the past years due to improvements in curricula and definition of years of schooling and aged of pupils. According to Gun and Baskan (2014), different laws were passed between 1997 and 2012 that affected the education system of TÃ¼rkiye. Table 1 below summarizes the changes and the importance of each. The most dramatic change took place in 2012 with the enactment of the 4+4+4 law that stated 4 years primary, 4 years elementary and 4 years high school to replace the previous law of 8 years of primary education.

Table 1. Pivotal changes in the education system

Year	Relevant Change
Pre 1997	5 year primary education
1997-2012	Formal implementation of the 8-year primary education system across the country
2012	Extension of primary education from 8 to 12 years in the form of 4+4+4
With the reform in 2012 the age of entrance to formal education changed to 5,5 years or 6 60-66 months, from the previous 69-80 months.

Changes in the questionnaire
The changes in the education system are ultimately reflected in the questionnaire. Below, Figures 1 and 2 show the classification of education used in the questionnaires from 2000 to 2013 (Figure 1) and from 2014 onwards (Figure 2)

Figure 1. HLFS education 2000 to 2013:

educ2013


Figure 2. HLFS education 2014 to 2019:

educ2014


As a result of the changes and the reduced set of categories, the GLD team only mapped education to the educat4 level to obtain a consistent time series.

Comparison with ILO data
The ILOSTAT website also contains information on employment by education level see here. These data were used to validate the GLD education categories. However, the four levels of education at the ILO do not correspond directly to the GLD levels, as the concept of "Basic education" for the ILO includes lower secondary, while GLD/GMD's educat4 differentiates between "No education", "Primary", "Secondary", "Beyond Secondary". The screenshot below has the ILO category definitions.

educ2014


Coding beyond four categories, mapping to ILO level
The below codes will allow users to map to educat7 or the ILO categories if they wish. In the case of 7 categories beware of potential inconsistencies in the time series.

Correspondence between the Turkish HLFS occupation codes and ISCO
This document first describes the logic of the process and then provides users with the underlying conversions tables as well as the the harmonization codes.

Occupation codes used in the Turkishâ€™s HLFS
The Turkish Labour Force Survey uses the ISCO system to classify occupation answers of the HLFS. There were three different classification systems between 2000 and 2019.

In the year 2000, the survey used the first digit of the ISCO-68 classification as per the ILO categories:

Scientific, technical, professional and related workers
Administrative, executive and managerial workers
Clerial and related workers
Sales workers
Service workers
Agricultural, animal husbandry and forestry workers, fisherman and hunters
Non-agricultural production and related workers, transport, equipment operators and labourers
Workers not classifiable by occupation
Between the years 2001-2011 the survey uses the first digit of the ISCO-88 classification again following the ILO categories.

Legislators, senior officials and managers
Professionals
Technicians and market sales workers
Clerks
Service workers and shop and market sales workers
Skilled agricultural and fishery workers
Craft and related trade workers
Plant and machine operators and assemblers
Elementary occupations
Finally between the years 2012-2019 the survey used the two digits of the ISCO-08 classification, below we show the highest level for simplicity yet more information on the different levels can be found in this links.

Managers
Professionals
Technicians and Associate Professionals
Clerical Support Workers
Services and Sales Workers
Skilled Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery Workers
Craft and Related Trades Workers
Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers
Elementary Occupations
Armed Forces Occupations
In the Harmonized GLD, skill level variables were developed for only ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 variables at the 1 digit level because the information of correspondance with ISCO-68 is not available in the ILO website. To learn more about skill level tables please visit the following link:






Source: ILO website - ISCO skill Correspondance Table

Limitations
In comparison to other surveys the process of mapping is straightforward in the NIGERIA HLFS but it only reaches the second level (digits) of detail from year 2012 to 2019.

List of variables per year for occupations harmonized
Below we list the questions that helped in the development of the harmonized occupation variable for all the survey years.
